            <h1>Identity-based access for zero trust security</h1>
            <p>
            Meeting new security requirements to support the dynamic cloud era requires a modern privileged access management (PAM) approach that is identity driven and built for the cloud. Boundary and Vault provide a secure way to access hosts and critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your network.
