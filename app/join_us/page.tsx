       As a multidimensional company addressing an extensive market, CompTech is experiencing hypergrowth, rapidly welcoming new customers, and continuing to expand our portfolio of tools. Our products are downloaded more than 100 million times a year, and we’ve expanded from 500 employees in June 2019 to more than 2,000 today — and we’re just getting started. That kind of scale opens up hard-to-find career-growth potential for our people to learn new skills, expand their roles, conquer new challenges, and solve new problems. To make that happen, we are increasingly investing in talent development, manager enablement,
        knowledge sharing, and other efforts to help our employees advance their careers.
